# Tinykern RISC-V

*A minimalist educational kernel to learn OS development.*

TinyKernel is a barebones operating system kernel developed as a student project. Its goal is to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of OS design â€” booting, memory management, task switching, and basic I/O.

For now only working on the `virt` machine via QEMU.

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ .devcontainer/      # Development container for vscode (includes toolchain and qemu)
â”œâ”€â”€ kernel/             # Kernel code (C and Assembly)
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/            # Useful scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt      # Global CMakeLists
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- GCC toolchain cross-compiler targeting `rv64ig`
- `qemu` (or any x86 emulator)
- `cmake`
- Linux (recommended) or WSL

### Build & Run

```bash
# Configure
mkdir build; cd build;

cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../scripts/riscv64_debug.cmake ..

# Build the kernel
make

# Run with QEMU
make qemu
continue # in qemu console

# Attach GDB
riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gdb --command ../scripts/qemu.gdb
```
